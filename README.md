# Python Code Examples

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This collection showcases code examples ranging from beginner to advanced topics. My goal is to demonstrate my expertise in Python programming, covering fundamental syntax, control flow, functions, object-oriented programming, and popular libraries.

**Note:** Examples are provided in both English and Spanish.

## About Me
Hello! I'm **Katlyn Goeujon-Mackness**, a Python developer and data scientist passionate about Python and its libraries. My main interest lies in machine learning algorithms and exploring the capabilities of tools like NumPy and scikit-learn.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into sections based on Python concepts and libraries:
1. [Fundamentals](#fundamentals)
2. [Libraries & Frameworks](#libraries-and-frameworks)
3. [Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics)

### **Fundamentals**
- **Data Types and Variables**  
  Learn about integers, floats, strings, and booleans, along with variable assignment and type conversion.
  
- **Conditionals (if/elif/else)**  
  Make decisions in code using conditional statements to execute different paths based on given conditions.  
  *(Provided in English and Spanish)*  

- **Control Flow**  
  Understand loops and logic structures to control the execution order of statements and efficiently manage repetition.  
  *(Spanish version available)*  

- **Functions**  
  Write reusable blocks of code with functions, including parameters, return values, and scope management.  
  *(Examples in both English and Spanish)*  

- **Lists**  
  Explore Python lists, a versatile data structure used to store ordered collections of elements and manipulate them efficiently.  
  *(English version available)*  

- **Dictionaries**  
  Utilize key-value storage with Python dictionaries for efficient lookups and data manipulation.

- **Tuples and Sets**  
  Discover immutable sequences (tuples) and unordered collections (sets) with unique elements.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  Learn about classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphismâ€”the foundation of OOP principles in Python.  
  *(Provided in both English and Spanish)*  

- **Error Handling**  
  Use `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `raise` statements to handle errors gracefully in Python.

### **Libraries and Frameworks**
- **Pandas**  
  Work with structured data using Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, including tables and time series.  
  *(Spanish version available)*  

- **Matplotlib**  
  Create informative visualizations with Matplotlib, a fundamental plotting library in Python for graphs, charts, and histograms.  
  *(Spanish version available)*  

- **NumPy**  
  Perform fast array manipulation and mathematical operations essential for scientific computing.

- **Scikit-learn**  
  Apply machine learning techniques including classification, regression, and clustering.

- **Requests**  
  Make HTTP requests to fetch data from APIs.

- **Flask or Django**  
  Build Python-based web applications using these popular web frameworks.

### **Advanced Topics**
- **File Handling**  
  Read, write, and manipulate text and binary files using Python.

- **Concurrency & Parallelism**  
  Utilize threading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming to optimize performance.

- **Regular Expressions**  
  Search and manipulate strings efficiently using regex patterns.

- **Data Visualization (Seaborn/Plotly)**  
  Create more advanced plots and charts beyond Matplotlib for enhanced data presentation.
